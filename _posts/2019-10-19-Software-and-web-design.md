## Color-based visualized mouse verification code system
>Bachelor's research, was finished at the Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2015.

Introduction:

Now the vast majority of web pages on the market when the importation of verification code for the image verification code, by entering the characters and figures on the picture to distinguish between people and machine behavior differences. But this type of character and digital verification code is not easy to identify, but easy to be identified by the machine. As the computer is not easy to capture the color characteristics, so the proposed color-based mouse-based visual verification code system to achieve the distinction between human and computer behavior. The system is based on VB language, the use of both shape and color recognition to determine. The graphic shape is inspired by the four colors in the poker, the red color of the same RGB value, but the black set a different brightness, allowing users to select from 9 pictures in line with the specified shape and color of the picture. Experiments show that the system can better distinguish between people and computer behavior, for the user's simplicity has also improved.
