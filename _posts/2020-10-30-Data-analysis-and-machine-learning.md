## Analysis and prediction of user behavior based on web log

The feature clustering algorithm based on similarity and the fuzzy analysis method based on rough set were used. A method of analysis and prediction of user behavior based on web log was proposed. Firstly, a standard character eigenvector library was constructed．Then，a character clustering algorithm based on cosine similarity was used for character analysis. Finally, a fuzzy analysis algorithm based on rough set theory was used to perform behavior prediction. Results showed that the method accurately analyze the personality characteristics of users and predict their future behaviors, and identify the groups that might pose a threat to the security field.

## Human emotion recognition based on facial expression

>The research was supervised by Professor Dr. Liang Liang at the University of Miami.

This research proposes a method for training convolutional neural networks for human facial expression image classification. The trained networks may be used for human emotions analysis in many applications,such as ensuringsafe driving and human-computer interaction. Commonly, a neural network can be trained by using whole face images. However, face outline can influence emotion recognition. Since the face outline can influence the emotion feature extraction. As a solution to this problem, we proposed to train a network on the key points of facial images. The average classification accuracy of the network is 33% (7 emotion classes), which shows it is a promising method.

## User emotion analysis and depression recognition system based on human-computer interaction

>The research (Master’s thesis) was supervised by Professor Dr. Liang Liang at the University of Miami.

This research includes three contents. The first one is detecting the position of the human face in the video that records the facial motions in the human-computer interaction processes and recognizing facial expression by using the convolutional neural network. The second one is calculating continuous values of three affective dimensions related to the facial expression: Valence, Arousal, and Dominance. The 3 dimensions values will be calculated in each frame during human-computer interaction. And the third one, analysis of the degree of depression can be provided to the psychologist to regulate the user’s emotions.

The process of this research is illustrated in the blueprint below.
