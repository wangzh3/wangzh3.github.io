## Arduino intelligence automatic driving car

The research of the automatic driving system is implemented based on the Arduino microcontroller platform by making the car model, connecting the circuit with the sensor and simulating the auto-driving core components of the car. The Arduino control program and the artificial intelligence algorithm are embedded into the Arduino microcontroller. The experiment proves that the system has good recognition accuracy of the route recognition. It can be further extended to be used in the real driving environment.

## Rose breath light

This project uses the LED light to simulate the roses blooming scene by implementing LED light up and extinguish effects. This project is implemented based on the Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller is placed in the blue box. When the button is pressed, a gradual light and extinguish process is implemented by the microcontroller. The frequency of light up and the exhalation is similar to the frequency of human breathing that can have a rose blooming effect in the visual sense.
