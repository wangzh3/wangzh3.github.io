## Arduino intelligence automatic driving car
>Bachelor's research, was finished at the Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2016.

Introduction:

With the rapid development of information technology and artificial intelligence algorithms, people pay attention to the application of artificial intelligence. During the winter vacation, I conducted a research practice of the Walking Intelligent Driving System. This practice is based on the Arduino single-chip platform, simulates the auto-driving core components of the car, makes the car model, and connects the circuit with the sensor, the Arduino control program and the intelligent algorithm. This experiment proves that the intelligent car model has certain recognition rate to the route. The system can be further extended to increase the machine learning algorithm used in real driving environment.

## Rose Breath Light
>Bachelor's research, was finished at the Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2017.

Introduction:

This work uses the led lights to light up and extinguish the effect to simulate the roses blooming scene. This work is based on the Arduino microcontroller, the microcontroller placed in the blue box, press the button, the use of program control to achieve a gradual light and extinguish the process, and make the light and the frequency of exhalation and the frequency of breathing Can have a rose blooming both visual sense.

The demo video is available [here](https://youtu.be/s8_IoeiL95I).
