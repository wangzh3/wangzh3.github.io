## Electronic commence website

>Master's internship, was completed at the Aispring (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

1. Designed the front end pages for users by using Html<br>
2. Designed the back end interfaces for administrator by using Html, JavaScript and JSP<br>
3. Implemented the database of the server by using Mysql

The demo version of the website is available [here](https://wangzh3.github.io/jinananhao/home.html).

The interface of the website is showed below.

## Color-based visualized mouse verification code system

>The research was directed by Professor Dr. Gang Zhao at the Beijing Information Science and Technology University.

The traditional verification code systems of web pages was implemented by entering the characters and digits on the image to distinguish people and computer behavior. However, this type of verification code is hard to identify for human, but easy to be identified by the computer.

Due to the computer is hard to capture the color characteristics, this research proposed the color-based mouse-based visual verification code system to distinguish human and computer login behavior by the recognition of the image object outline, RGB scale, and grayscale. There are 4 different graphic images and 2 kinds of colors which are red and gray. In the pilot study, the red color of the graphics has the same RGB value, the gray color has different grayscale. Users must select all images that correspond to the specified shape and color of the picture from the 9 randomly generated images.

The system is implemented by using the VB language. Experiments show that the system can better distinguish between people and computer behavior, for the user's simplicity has also improved.

The interface of the system is showed below.
